IT266 Final Project

Half Life 2 Multiplayer Australian Mod
Instructions: Put the client/server DLLs where they would go in another HL2MP mod. Everything should work at that point.

Changes:

-Players are constantly jumping like kangaroos

-The RPG flies in a boomerang arc

-The screen is upside down 

I only included the files I modified to save space/time. Search "jc429" for my edits
